While win_loss isn't None
Do the front thing in the list.
NOTE: There shouldn't be 20 Energy Events. There should be one.
Energy Event should do two things: Set its own time signature to +5 current, and set all players' energy to +5 (in a 1-player game, this is "set THE player's energy to +5").

During the player turn they can win. If their action reduces a node to 0 remaining work, the system removes the node from the list of nodes, and checks whether the node list is empty. If so, win_loss is set to "Win".
Outside the player turn they can lose. If their action doesn't reduce the last node in the node list to 0, it moves their time forward and if the player's time is ever past the Loss point they lose the scenario - win_loss is set to "Loss".

Following the while loop of "while it isn't None" there's an if-else for the game to declare victory or defeat for the player. That's cleaner and more readable than having defeat inside the Loss event and victory inside the function that checks whether the individual node completed.
