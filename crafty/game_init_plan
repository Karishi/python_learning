Starting plan for the game initialization:
1) Create 3-5 targets.
2) Randomize elements.
3) Randomize values within range for first x-1, but last one is 100-(others)

4) Draw a hand of cards.

Ordering this a little more carefully:
'Target' objects contain a "truth" string, an "options" list of strings, and a "value" int.
First thing that happens is a randomization of how many targets will exist. This gets stored in a value for later. There's also a "subtotal" int variable.
Second, there's a for-loop where x-1 of the 3 to 5 get picked with values 5 to 90/(x-1), or roughly 45 for 3, 30 for 4, and 23 for 5. As the loop goes, the roll is added to subtotal.
Options always starts as the full list of element options, and Truth is picked randomly from the list on initialization.
For the final target, the value is 100-subtotal, though the element is just as random as the rest.

Display has something like
print(f"({target.value})" + target.options) in a for loop
