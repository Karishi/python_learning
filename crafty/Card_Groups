Card Groups
Essentially, the idea is that for early testing of card integrity and general game function without spending a long time developing individual cards, I'll come up with six "generic" card groups that will work the same regardless of element.

Gentle: Gentle cards cost half as much as listed, tilted toward the player. Specifically they cost nothing the first time you play them and then grant the "Relaxed" status. The next Gentle card you play costs the normal amount and removes "Relaxed," and so on. There could also be Gentle cards with different costs, making a situation where you could get the free effect the first time with the expensive one, then pay for the cheap one, rinse and repeat. Bonus: Both effects. The Relaxed status is removed if present, AND the card costs no time.
Desperate: Desperate cards increase in effect the less time you have left. They have a weak effect when the attempt starts, but increase in impact to a maximum value at 50%. At the same time, when you hit 50%, they switch from targeting a single node to hitting all of them. Desperate cards have no Bonus effect, but cause you to gain 1 energy for every 5 time you've spent.
Deductive: If this card is used to reveal the true element of a node, you gain double its time cost instead of spending it. (+8 instead of -4, for instance). If all nodes are revealed Deductive cards cost half. Bonus: The effect of revealing the true element is gained even if the node was already revealed.
Thorough: If this card removes a false element from a node, it removes an extra false element if possible (For node (15) S X A D O Y if a Thorough (A) card with 3 impact were used the new result might be (12) S X D Y) No Bonus but gains 5 energy if used on the matching element.
Patient: These cards are expensive but affect all nodes. Bonus: Refund 3 of the time cost for each matching element.
Complete: These cards refund their full price and grant +10 energy if they finish a Node.
