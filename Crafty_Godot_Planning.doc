Potentially have a supply of cards in background "collection" zone which can be added to deck.
Potentially have a supply of cards in background "cardbase" zone which can be added to collection.
I think Hearthstone had everything in the cardbase exist in the collection, but hidden.
Toggling the "owned" status on a card made it usable in the collection, but it was there (grayed out).
This let players plan based on cards they wanted to get, etc.
Start from vanilla card for fundamental card testing purposes.
